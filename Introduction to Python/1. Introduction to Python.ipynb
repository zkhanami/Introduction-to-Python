Primary Memory can be further classified as **RAM** and **ROM**\n","\n","  * RAM (Random Access Memory) is the place in a computer where\n","the operating system, application programs and the\n","data in current use are kept temporarily so that they\n","can be accessed by the computer's processor. It is\n","said to be \"volatile\" (unstable) since its contents are accessible\n","only as long as the computer is on. The contents of RAM are no more available once the computer is\n","turned off. There are 2 main types of RAM: **Dynamic RAM (DRAM)** and **Static RAM (SRAM)**. DRAM has to be refreshed every few milliseconds to retain data, unlike SRAM that keeps data in the memory as long as power is supplied to the system. SRAM is faster but more expensive, making DRAM more common in computer systems.\n","  * ROM (Read Only Memory) is a special type of memory\n","which can only be read and contents of which are not\n","lost even when the computer is switched off. ROM mainly contains manufacturer's instructions and also stores an initial program called the\n","\"bootstrap loader\" whose function is to start the operation of computer system once the power is turned on.\n","\n","2.  Secondary Memory\n","\n","Secondary memory is storage other than the RAM, including hard disks, CDs, DVDs,USBs etc.\n","\n","![Computer Memory](https://www.atpinc.com/upload/images/2018/11-08/7ad78cfc059443bab70a2d7848fd4d4a.jpg)\n","\n","## Functional Units\n","\n","1. **Input Unit**: This unit is used for entering data and programs into the computer system by the user for\n","processing.\n","2. **Storage Unit**: The storage unit is used for storing data\n","and instructions before and after processing.\n","3. **Output Unit**: The output unit is used for storing the\n","result as output produced by the computer after\n","processing.\n","4. **Processing**: The task of performing operations like\n","arithmetic and logical operations is called processing.\n","The **Central Processing Unit (CPU)** takes data and\n","instructions from the storage unit and makes all sorts of\n","calculations based on the instructions given and the type\n","of data provided.

When there are specialized programs that require *complex mathematical calculations*, such as **deep learning** or **machine learning**, those calculations can be offloaded by the GPU.

Byte code can run much more quickly than the original code statements in the text file. Python will store the byte code of the program in files that end with a .pyc extension after running the program for the first time.

This is especially a drawback when we are writing a large program. To avoid this problem, we can write programs in text files (with .py extension), as mentioned above, then pass it to the Python interpreter through the command line.
